           <h2>In pair programming there are two primary positions, driver and navigator. 
            The driver is the person who writes the code into the the system. 
            The navigator guides the driver and reports errors and changes that need to be made.  
            The benefits of pair programming include learning new ways to navigate code, learn new methods to do things you already know how to do. 
            In addition you have the support of another programmer to support your learning and catch syntax mistakes.  How great!
            Pair programming uses the strengths of each programmer to work on areas they know best and increase the efficiency of the process.</h2>
