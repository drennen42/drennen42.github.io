				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Coding In Pairs</strong></p>

				<p>I am quickly learning the importance of development in pairs.  Pair sessions, as we call them in DevBootcamp, are when two or more people work together to solve a challenge. 
				</p>

				<p>Pair programming enables developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes, when done correctly.  Good lines of communication while working together are key.  This does not come easily and must be practiced.  Communication must be open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect.<sub>1</sub></p>

				<p>There are many advantages of peer-programming.  One advantage is that the coding is instantly checked by another set of eyes <b>as it is being created</b>.  This can save countless hours of debugging and editing down the road.  Imagine coding something yourself, and you're 250 lines into the code and something just isn't working.  You start testing and changing the code hoping to figure out what is causing the program to break, and after an hour or so of this, you find out that you put a colon instead of a semi-colon somewhere.  Or a period instead of a comma.  Something so minor yet so significant.  Syntax errors like this can be found immediately while writing that line of code if you were to have been working with a pair rather than by yourself.  And that hour that you spent searching for that period, could have been spent finishing the program or creating something new completely.</p>

				<p>This type of developing is rapidly becoming popular in the business world.  Employers are looking for developers who have experience programing seemlessly in pairs.  These developers can more efficiently, more quickly, create code that is better, nearly error free, and more durable than developers that work alone.</p>

				<p>In DBC, after a pair session, we are required to give feedback on the session and to the person we paired with.  The feedback is to be kind, actionable, and specific.  This type of feedback is to help us learn to be great partners and be sought-after developers upon graduation.</p>

				<p>Kind feedback does not necessarily mean that is has to be "nice", per say.  Kind feedback just means that it should not be hateful not hurtful, but more respectfully constructive.  If I were a stubborn partner that did not listen to the ideas of my partner, I would hope and expect to have feedback that said "I wish you were more open to hearing and possibly using some of my ideas during this pair session."  This is kind and respectful feedback.  It tells me that I was selfish and stubborn during the session without actually saying "You are very selfish and stubborn."  Also, that feedback gives me something actionable to work on.  Instead of trying to work on my overall stubborness, I would know to start working on hearing and using my partners ideas.</p>

				<p>Actionable feedback is just that, feedback that the person can use as something to work on for their future sessions and to learn and grow from.</p>

				<p>It is only helpful if the feedback is specific.  If the feedback were to just say "It was a good session, we achieved our goals."  there would be nothing for the person to work on.  More importantly, if they did something particularly well, that should be stated so they know to continue doing that.</p>
