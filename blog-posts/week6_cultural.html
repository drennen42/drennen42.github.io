				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Stereotype Threats</strong></p>

				<p>A Stereotype threat is defined by www.oxfodscholarship.com as "a situational predicament in which individuals are at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their group. It is the resulting sense that one might be judged in terms of negative stereotypes about one's group instead of on personal merit."
				</p>

				<p>There have been many studies done on stereoype threats.  The results of the studies show that when two groups, one group being the group that is the subject of a stereotype and the other group being the opposite of the stereotype, are given the same test, the first time with no prior knowledge of the test being a stereotype test, both groups performed relatively equally.  Then, the second time, the groups are informed that the purpose of the test is related to the stereotype, the group that is the subject/victim of the stereotype performed down to the level of the stereotype.
				</p>

				<p>For example, there is a stereotype that African Americans are bad academic test takers.  A group of Caucasians and a group of African Americans are given the same test, with no knowledge of the purpose of the test, both groups performed well.  Then, when the African Americans were informed that the purpose of the test is to determine whether or not the stereotype of African Americans are bad test takers, the group of African Americans performed worse.  Simply because the expectations are lowered due to the stereotype, the stereotype is confirmed.
				</p>

				<p>I cannot think of a time when I felt like a victim of a stereotype threat.  However, I can imagine how it could and does effect people who are victims.  I believe that it is human nature to gravitate towards performing to expectations of ourselves.  When expectations are lowered due to stereotyping, we evolve and react accordingly to the level of the stereotype.</p>

				<p>I believe that the solution to stereotype threats can be achieved by spreading the word about the effects of stereotypes.  Stereotype Threats are a serious problem and effect everyone in one way or another.  Since stereotypes are created over a long period of time and evolution of whole groups of people, concquoring stereotype threats will take many years and a lot of selfless, humble dedication by multiple generations in succession to allow for new evolution to occur.  But, the change must start somewhere and it must begin with strong individuals standing up for their beliefs.  Be a part of the change for the better and do not put up with stereotype threats and make all attempts to change the minds of those doing the stereotyping.
