				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Favorite Sites</strong></p>
				<p><strong><font size="14"><u><a href="www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></u></font></strong></p>
					<p>I probably use facebook the most out of any other site right now.  It is a great way to stay connected with friends and family.  Facebook also hosts a huge amount of great apps.  Most of the apps that I use on facebook are games, but there are also many productive apps too. </p>


				<p><strong>Area my eye is drawn to:</strong>  The news feed.</p>


				<p><strong>Area my eye is drawn to when I move back away from the screen:</strong>  <em>The sponsored ads</em>.  No, this is not the most important area of the page to me.  It probably is the most important area for the company sponsoring the ad and for investors in Facebook though.</p>


				<p><strong>My description of the homepage:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Active</li>
						<li>Cluttered</li>
						<li>Pretty boring color</li>
						<li>Basic layout</li>
						<li>Forum-esque</li>
					</ul>
				</p>


				<p><strong>Problem it solves</strong>:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Disconnecting from friends and family</li>
						<li>Having too much personal space</li>
						<li>Too much privacy</li>
					</ul></p>

				<p><strong>Content:</strong><br>
				Everything that anyone in the world wants to share with everyone else in the world via pictures, posts, stories, comments, hashtags, etc etc.</p>


				<p><strong>Content description:</strong><br>
				Facebook can really contain any kind of content.  Most of it is fun, silly stuff, but some people post some pretty serious stuff.</p>


				<p>It's very easy to find what I am looking for on Facebook.  You can use the search bar or the navigation links to get to pretty much anywhere you want right from the homepage.  The search bar and the links are available from any page you are on within facebook.</p>

				<p>After being on Facebook for a while, I definitely get the feeling that I wasted a lot of time.  Generally I get hooked into spending far too much time on there than necessary.</p>

				<p>Facebook doesn't sell anything, only the sponsored ads try to sell you stuff.</p>
				<br>

				<p><strong><font size="14"><a href="www.thechive.com">TheChive</a></font></strong><br><br>
				TheChive is one of my favorite web sites because it is very visually attractive.  TheChive posts new albums of photos multiple times per day.  There are many categories of photo albums on TheChive, some (most) are hilarious, some are funny, some are humerous, and some are sarcastic.  TheChive is also an organization that hosts many charities that are making the headlines for raising an astounding amount of funds for individual charities in a very short time frame.  Most of the charities are to help specific people who are disabled or became disabled serving our country or in tragic mishaps.</p>

				<p><strong>Area my eye is drawn to:</strong> The "Most Popular" section at the top.</p>

				<p>Area my eye is drawn to when I move back away from the screen: Still the "Most Popular" section at the top.  TheChive does have a few ads on it's homepage, but they do not seem to be the focal point whether I am close nor far away from the screen.  This tells me something about the site, the organization, and the fine people keeping TheChive true to itself. KCCO!</p>

				<p><strong>Visual Description:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Dark</li>
						<li>Cool</li>
						<li>Modern</li>
						<li>Visually pleasing</li>
						<li>Fun</li>
						<li>Oh, and: <strong>Probably the Best Site in the World.</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Boredom</li>
						<li>Sadness</li>
						<li>Curiosity</li>
					</ul>
				</p>


				<p><strong>Content:</strong><br>
				Awesomeness in the form of pictures, charities, and comments.<br>

				<p><strong>Content description:</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Fun</li>
						<li>Awesome</li>
						<li>Funny</li>
						<li>Silly</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>It's fairly easy to find what you are looking for at TheChive.  There are links to all categories of photo albums as well as a search bar.  However, to find a specific photo album, you must either know the exact name of it to search for it or go through lots of albums under the category it falls in.</p>

				<p>Once off the homepage, the search bar and the category links are still available at the top, so it is the same level of difficulty.</p>

				<p>After being on TheChive for a while, I am always happy that I spent whatever amount of time on there, but at the same time, that I really accomplished nothing at all. </p>

				<p>TheChive has a shop called TheChivery.  They sell apparel and a lot of knick-knacks.  Yes, I have purchased a hoodie and a T-shirt from TheChivery.  I purchased them because they are very comfortable, fashionable, and most importantly, they show that I am a proud supporter of TheChive (proceeds from sales go to charities).</p>
				<br>

				<p><strong><font size="14"><a href="www.google.com">Google</a></font></strong> <font size="4">(and all google apps such as drive, calendar, maps, etc etc)</font></p>

				<p>Google is one of my favorite websites simply because google basically runs my life at this point.  I use google calendars, google maps, google drive, google docs, google+, gmail, gchat, regular ol' google web search, google music, google play, google photos, google translate, google wallet, YouTube, and so on and so on.  Basically I can trace any single thing that I do back to Google in one way or another.  Google has made it extremely simple to use everything they offer.</p>

				<p><strong>Area my eye is drawn to:</strong><br> Google's homepage is very very VERY simple.  There is basically nothing on it except for the Google logo and a search bar.  Can't beat the simplicity of it!</p>

				<p><strong>Area my eye is drawn to when I move back away from the screen:</strong><br>  Of course, it's still the Google logo and the search bar since that honestly is all that is on their homepage. </p>

				<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Basic</li>
						<li>Simple</li>
						<li>Clean</li>
						<li>Easy</li>
						<li>Un-cluttered</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Problem it solves:</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Ignorance</li>
						<li>Unorganization</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Content:</strong><br>
				Search engine that is extremely easy to use and is full of smartness.  Endless amount of applications that help organize everybody's lives.  Maps to navigate.</p>

				<p><strong>Content description:</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Serious</li>
						<li>Everyday life type of stuff</li>
						<li>But you can search for anything, so it can be silly too.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>If you're on Google, you probably don't know exactly what you are looking for, so it's tough to say how easily you'll find it.  But MOST Google searches lead you directly to what you were hoping to find.  If you're on Google to use one of their apps like calendar, maps, or drive, it's very easy to get there.  Just login with your credentials and click the dropdown box of their apps and voila.</p>

				<p>The search bar and the dropdown box of apps go with you on whatever page you are on within google.</p>

				<p>If I have spent some time on google doing google searches, I would probably be frustrated after a while of not being able to find what I am looking for.  But, if I end up spending a lot of time working on my calendar, a google doc, or on gmail, usually I leave with a feeling of accomplishment.</p>

				<p>I don't think Google sells anything directly from their website, though I am not sure about that.  No, I have not bought any google products yet, but it seems like maybe I should show some support after listing out all of their apps that I use daily!</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Margins, Borders, and Paddings</strong></p>
				<p>The purpose of this post is to provide information about margins, borders, and padding and the differences between them.
				</p>
				<div id="article_image">
					<p><img src="images/MPB.png" alt="Margins Borders & Paddings image" style="margin-left:25%"></p>
				</div>
				<br>
				For illustration purposes, we've included the image above that you can refer to.
				<br>
				<br>
				<p><strong><font size="14">Margins</font></strong></p>
				<br>
				<p>The first thing you'll notice about the image above is the outer layer, which is appropiately labeled "margin."
				<br>
				<strong>Margins</strong> are defined as the area surrounding an element, outside of it's border. Margins separate an element from the surrounding elements by the margin's defined width.
				<br>
				There a few options you can use to properly set the size of a margin.  Margins are measured in three different sets of units:
				<ul>
					<li>pixels</li>
					<li>ems</li>
					<li>percentages</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				Each of these are used under different circumstances depending on the goals of the developer. Generally, pixels are used for elements that have fixed sizes while ems and percentages are used to ensure that elements maintain their sizes when screens are resized or when distributing to an audience that may have a variety of screen sizes.
				<br>
				Here is an example of how the CSS code looks when setting a margin's properties:
				<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
					margin: 0, 10px, 0, 20px;<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
				    margin: 10px;<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
				  margin-left: 10px;<br>
				  }<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  <p><strong><font size="14">Borders</font></strong></p>
				  <br>
				A <strong>border</strong> is the area between a margin and a padding.  The image shown above may be slightly deceiving.  The image makes it look like a border is approximately the same width as a margin or a padding; however, a border can be as thin as half of a pixel or even invisible, yet it still exists.  Margins and paddings do not exist unless you create them.  The reason developers set borders to be visible is generally for aesthetic/visual purposes only.
				There are more options available for borders than for margins/paddings such as style, color, width, texture. <br>
				Here is the CSS code for a border:
				<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
				    <p class="tab">border-style: ridge;<br>
				    	border-width: 10px;<br>
				    	border-color: silver;<br></p>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p><strong><font size="14">Padding</font></strong></p>
				<br>
				<p>Lastly, the layer directly surrounding the element itself is called the <strong>padding</strong>. The padding in many ways can be thought of like the inverse of the margin. Rather than separating the element from other elements as the margin does, the padding separates the element from it's own border.
				Paddings have the exact same units of measurement to choose from as margins - pixels, ems, or percentages and the syntax for setting the width using CSS is the same:
				<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
					padding: 0, 10px, 0, 20;<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
				  padding: 10px;<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				.class {<br>
				  padding-left: 10px;<br>
				  }<br>
				  <br>
					  <p>Here is an image of the Google logo that you see on Google's homepage.
					  	<br>The section highlighted in green is the padding.
					  	<br>The section highlighted in blue is the element. I.e. The element is the image of the Google logo
					  	<br>which might be named something like "google_logo.jpg" in google's repository.
					  	<br>
					  <p><img src="images/google_padding.png" alt="Google's Paddings image" style="margin-left:15%"></p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Javascript is the Bomb</strong></p>


				<p>JavaScript is a top language due to its ability to deliver rich web content and its relatively light weight and ease of use. JavaScript is a good fit for mobile development platforms; after all, both Apple and Google exposed JavaScript application programming interfaces to their mobile development toolkits in order to expand their developer base.<sub>1</sub></p>

				<p>JavaScript is the reason web users are able to input information and interact with most websites they visit each day; this is huge, it's the only language in the browser. JavaScript and its relationship to the browser are critical to our web user experience. Learning the language can be huge for a future computer programmer.<sub>4</sub></p>

				<p>So this is all great. JavaScript is easy (relatively speaking) to use, speedy, and hey, everyone's doing it! But, there are some limitations. The downside of an interpreted language is that testing can be optional in some people's minds - the compiler isn't there say no. Because there's no compiler you might be tempted to skip testing...or really skimp on it.<sub>5</sub></p>

				<p>Think about Google Maps, AirBnB, Uber, just about any hot application with a sexy client-side interface. That's JavaScript, and it's the only game in town. So, get busy learnin'!</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Ruby Methods</strong></p>
				<p style="font-size:26px"><strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html#method-i-include-3F">Array#include?</a></strong></p>
					<p>Ruby's built-in method 'Array#include?' is a public Ruby method that searches through all elements of an array for a given object, provided as a parameter by the object that called it, and returns the boolean 'true' or 'false' if that object is found in the array.
				</p>
					<p>The method 'Array#include?' is a must-know for all Ruby developers.  In fact, any method that searches for a given element in an array is a necessity for all programmers, regardless of the language they develop in.
					</p>
					<p>The vast majority of developer positions include large quantities of data that must be searched through.  Many times the data is company data or client data that may include things such as first names, last names, addresses, phone numbers, etc etc.  This data can be stored in an array or, more likely, many many arrays and possibly many arrays OF arrays.  Without having a method that is capable of quickly scanning through all of that data, it would be nearly impossible to effectively and efficiently find and use any specific information.
					</p>
					<p><b>Syntax:</b> array_name.include?(element_you_need_to_find)
					</p>
					<p>For example, if you have an array called <em>'clients'</em> and it currently holds:
						<br>["Alex Drennen", "Fictional Person", "Michael Jordan", "Donald Trump"]
						<br>
						<br>You can use this method to find out if I am a client with:
						<br>clients.include?("Alex Drennen")
						<br>
						<br>This will return 'true'.
					</p>
					<p>What may be even more important is that you can use this method within a loop and have all elements that are found in the array returned to be used or printed out. For example:
						<br>
						<br>>>clients = ["Alex Drennen", "Fictional Person", "Michael Jordan", "Donald Trump"]
						<br>>>list_of_names = ["Bob McGee", "Alex Drennen", "Person Three", "George Fakerson", "Michael Jordan", "Chevy Chase"]
						<br>>>	list_of_names.eah do |x|
						<br>>>		if clients.include? (x)
						<br>>>			puts x
						<br>>>		end
						<br>>>	end
						<br>
						<br>This will print to the console all names that are in both the clients array and the list_of_names array. Which in this case would be:
						<br>"Alex Drennen"
						<br>"Michael Jordan"
					</p>

			<article><a name="RubyClasses"></a>
				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Ruby Classes</strong></p>

				<p>In all programming languages, classes help developers from having to type repetitive code.  Creating a class allows a developer to create an object of that class that automatically inherits all characteristics of that class.  When a new instance of a class is created, all inherited variabled and methos that come along with that object are called 'instance variables' and 'instance methods'.  Changes made to the instance variables and methods only effect themselves and not the class that they were formed from.</p>

				<p>One classic basic examples that is used when learning to create classes, instance variables, and instance methods of that class is the vehicle class example.</p>

				<p>In the vehicle class example, you create a class called 'vehicle' that has variables such as 'num_wheels', 'num_doors', 'color', 'max_speed', and any other broad characteristics of a vehicle.  Along with these variables, there are methods such as 'beep', 'go', and 'stop'.</p>

				<p>It is necessary to initialize the variables within the class so that new objects of the class can use them.

				<p>Once the class is created, you can create as many instances of the class as you'd like, each instance of the class will contain all the previously initialized variables and methods of the vehicle class.  For example, if I had Ford Mustang and a Toyota Camry, I would create two instances of the vehicle class like so: <br>
					<ul>
						<li>ford_mustang = Vehicle.new(4,4,silver,190)</li>
						<li>toyota_camry = Vehicle.new(4,4,black,150)</li>
					</ul></p>

				<p>We now have two vehicle objects, both with 4 wheels and 4 doors, the Mustang is silver and has a max speed of 190 while the Camry is black with a max speed of 150.</p>

				<p>Both of these vehicles can beep, go, and stop.</p>

				<p>Here is a diagram of the vehicle class's initialize method:</p>

				<table style="width:32.5%">
					<tr>
						<th style="text-align:center">Vehicle</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>@num_wheels = num_wheels</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>@num_doors = num_doors</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>@color = color</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>@speed = speed</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>beep()</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>go()</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>stop()</td>
					</tr>

			<article><a name="OOvsFunctional"></a>
				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>OO vs. Functional Programming</strong></p>

				<p>When I first started to learn to code, everything I was taught was functional style programming.  I started with the basic Pascal language and then dove into simple windows batch file scripting.
				</p>

				<p>The premise of functional programming is that everything is coded "in-line".  You can read the code from top to bottom and that is exactly how the program runs.  Basically it follows the format of:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Do step one</li>
						<li>Then do step two</li>
						<li>Then do step three</li>
					</ul><br>
					So on and so forth.
				</p>

				<p>This is a good way to code when you expect that your program will have just one "thing" that does or has many "functions".  This style of developing allows the developer to add new functions to the "thing" easily and at any time.
				</p>

				<p>However, the downfall of this type of developing is that you cannot easily add new "things" to the program.
				</p>

				<p>Let's take the recent solo challenge that we had in week 6 for example.  The challenge was to create a program that would create playlists of songs and also have the functionality of printing out which song was currently playing as well as allowing the user to "play-all songs on the playlist".
				</p>

				<p>If this were coded in the functional programmin style, we would only be allowed to create one playlist and give that playlist the functions of printing the current song and playing all songs.  But if we wanted to create another playlist later on, we would have to re-create the whole program over again! (Or, most likely copy and paste the whole source code into a new source code, but whatever!  Still not very friendly!)  In this example, I am not even going to mention the difficulty of creating new songs and adding them to the playlist!
				</p>

				<p>In comparison, Object Oriented programming (OOP) does not follow the same syntax of running code from top to bottom.  In OOP, objects are created that each have their own functionality in the form of methods.  All objects of the same type, when created, are initialized automatically with the same functions.
				</p>

				<p>OOP is good for developing programs that have many "things" (a.k.a. objects) and a set number of "functions" (a.k.a. methods) that each of the objects can have.  OOP allows the developer to add new "things" easily and at any time, but it is much harder to add additional "functions" later on.
				</p>

				<p>In the playlist example, using OOP is the prefered choice.  With OOP we can create as many playlist objects as we like.  Each playlist object will have their own methods to print out which song is currently playing and to play all songs on the list (or, this could be said "play all songs on itself" since it IS the list!)
				</p>

				<p>Because I used this particular challenge as an example, it may seem that OOP is just way better than functional programming all around.  But there are times when functional programming trumps OOP.  Say you were assigned to write a program for a remote-controlled car.  You are only going to be writing the program for that car, you will not be adding another car to that car, right?  But, on the other hand, you may start the program giving the car the functions go, stop, turn right, and turn left.  What if later on you want to give that car the ability to go backwards or to do a backflip?  With functional programming, you can just tack on the new functions to the existing code and you're done! With OOP, you've have to add the new functions (methods) to each object, which in this case is only the one car, but OOP isn't setup to only create one car.  It's setup to create many car objects!
				</p>

				<p>It's hard to tell which style I like best or which one I find easier than the other.  But I will say that since I started with functional programming, many times my brain gets 'stuck' in it's old ways and gravitates towards functional programming even when I'm trying to use OOP.  So, if you're just starting out, my suggestion is to not code in one way or the other for too long without switching it up every once in a while.  This will help you get a well-rounded knowledge and experience in both styles.

			<article><a name="SQLInjections"></a>
				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>SQL Injections</strong></p>

				<p>Why would anyone want to do a SQL injection? A SQL injection is something that a hacker does to get access to all of the data stored in a website's backend database.  The data can be user id's, passwords, banking information, account #s, just about anything.  Much of the data the hacker is seeking is personal information and can be very harmful.

				<p>How are SQL injections performed?  Say you're about to login to a website like Facebook and you're looking at the login fields 'user name' and 'password'.  The site probably has a database of all of its users' user names and passwords that is cross checks the users input for validation.  The website's [pseudo]code may be soemthing like:<br>
					<br>
					>Grab username from user_name text field<br>
					>SELECT account FROM tbl_accounts WHERE user_name=username<br>
					<br>
					So what if in the user name text field you entered in 'NOT NULL'? Then the site's code would pull all accounts from tbl_accounts where the user_name is not null!!
				</p>

				<p>How to prevent SQL attacks?  FIrewalls and other intrusion detection mechanisms provide little defense against full-scale web attacks. The best way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use prepared statements, using stored procedures, and escaping all user supplied input.  There are many resources online where you can find examples of how to use prepared statements and other suggestions on how to prevent SQL injections.

			<article><a name="Recursion"></a>
				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Recursion</strong></p>

				<p>
          The simplest way to define recursion in development is that when a function or method calls itself.  The most popular and simplest form of recursion are loops.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take, for example, a ruby while loop.  The while loop is written like this:<br>
          <br><br>
          while (condition == true)<br>
               [block of code to run]<br>
          end<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          In order to explain this better, I think a real example should be used: <br>
          <br><br>
          <code>
          i = 0<br>
          while (i<10)<br>
              puts i<br>
              i += 1<br>
          end<br>
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          What this code is doing is recursion, or calling itself over and over again.  First it checks if the variable 'i' is less than 10.  If that is true, then it runs the block of code.  The block of code will print out the current value of 'i', then increment the value of 'i' by 1 and start over again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's go through the while loop step by step.  Before the loop begins, the value of 'i' is initially set to 0:
          <ol>
            <li>is 0 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 0</li>
            <li>0 + 1 = 1 (now i = 1)</li>
            <li>is 1 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 1</li>
            <li>1 + 1 = 2 (now i = 2)</li>
            <li>is 2 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 2</li>
            <li>2 + 1 = 3 (now i = 3)</li>
            <li>is 3 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 3</li>
            <li>3 + 1 = 4 (now i = 4)</li>
            <li>is 4 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 4</li>
            <li>4 + 1 = 5 (now i = 5)</li>
            <li>is 5 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 5</li>
            <li>5 + 1 = 6 (now i = 6)</li>
            <li>is 6 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 6</li>
            <li>6 + 1 = 7 (now i = 7)</li>
            <li>is 7 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 7</li>
            <li>7 + 1 = 8 (now i = 8)</li>
            <li>is 8 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 8</li>
            <li>8 + 1 = 9 (now i = 9)</li>
            <li>is 9 less than 10? - true! Run code block.</li>
            <li>puts 9</li>
            <li>9 + 1 = 10 (now i = 10)</li>
            <li>is 10 less than 10? - FALSE!</li>
            <li>END while loop</li>
          </ol>

          <br>
          The output of this code would look like this:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>0</li>
            <li>1</li>
            <li>2</li>
            <li>3</li>
            <li>4</li>
            <li>5</li>
            <li>6</li>
            <li>7</li>
            <li>8</li>
            <li>9</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Recursion is a very important part of programming.  It is a MUST-KNOW for all programmers and is one of the very first things all programmers learn.
