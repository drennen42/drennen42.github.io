				<p><strong><font size="14">Facebook</font></strong><br>
					I probably use facebook the most out of any other site right now.  It is a great way to stay connected with friends and family.  Facebook also hosts a huge amount of great apps.  Most of the apps that I use on facebook are games, but there are also many productive apps too. </p>

				<p>Area my eye is drawn to:  The news feed.</p>

				<p>Area my eye is drawn to when I move back away from the screen:  <em>The sponsored ads</em>.  No, this is not the most important area of the page to me.  It probably is the most important area for the company sponsoring the ad and for investors in Facebook though.</p>

				<p>My description of the homepage:
					<ul>
						<li>Active</li>
						<li>Cluttered</li>
						<li>Pretty boring color</li>
						<li>Basic layout</li>
						<li>Forum-esque</li>
					</ul>
				</p>


				<p><strong>Problem it solves</strong>:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Disconnecting from friends and family</li>
						<li>Having too much personal space</li>
						<li>Too much privacy</li>
					</ul></p>
				<p><strong>Content:</strong><br>
				Everything that anyone in the world wants to share with everyone else in the world via pictures, posts, stories, comments, hashtags, etc etc.</p>

				<p><strong>Content description:</strong><br>
				Facebook can really contain any kind of content.  Most of it is fun, silly stuff, but some people post some pretty serious stuff.</p>

				<p>It's very easy to find what I am looking for on Facebook.  You can use the search bar or the navigation links to get to pretty much anywhere you want right from the homepage.  The search bar and the links are available from any page you are on within facebook.</p>

				<p>After being on Facebook for a while, I definitely get the feeling that I wasted a lot of time.  Generally I get hooked into spending far too much time on there than necessary.</p>

				<p>Facebook doesn't sell anything, only the sponsored ads try to sell you stuff.</p>
