				<p><strong><font size="14">Concrete-Random</font></strong><br>
					Concrete-Random: Practical and live in the physical world, but they like to learn by trial and error.  Rather than a plan, they want options.				
				</p>

				<p>Characteristics of a Concrete-Random Mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Thinking processes are instinctive, intuitive, and impulsive.</li>
						<li>Events affected by outside variables.</li>
						<li>Focus on practical applications, methods, and processes.</li>
						<li>Creativity is original, inventive, and unique.</li>
						<li>Prefer an environment that is stimulus rich and competitive.</li>
					</ul>

				<p><strong><font size="14">Abstract-Sequential</font></strong><br>
					Abstract-Sequential: Like to develop ideas in a logical way.  How someone feels about something does not change reality.
				</p>

				<p>Characteristics of a Abstract-Sequential Mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Thinking processes are intellectual, analytical, correlative, fluid, and quick.</li>
						<li>Loves books.</li>
						<li>Focus attention on knowledge, concepts, and ideas.</li>
						<li>Creativity lies within models, theories, and synthesizing.</li>
						<li>Prefer an environment that is ordered, quiet, independent, and mentally stimulating.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

					<p>Being that my thinking style consists of many impulsive processes, many times I find myself jumping to do the first thing that comes to mind while reading through a challenge.  Many times I find out later that if I would have read the rest of the challenge more thoroughly, I could have saved myself a lot of time and energy.</p>

					<p>I have also found that the majority of the time when I am trying to be creative, I end up focusing more on practical applications.  This was a big challenge to overcome during week 1 of phase 0, when we were asked to be very creative and create unique web pages.</p>

					<p>The biggest struggle during unit 1 of phase 0 so far has been being creative while creating HTML and CSS webpages.  This does relate directly to my learning style because I keep thinking that after the proper ideas are portrayed, the stlying and creativness of a webpage does not matter in reality, hence the Abstract-Sequential characteristic of not believing that superfulous things do not change reality.  The reality is that the webpage is still just as functional with or without the attractive colors or the way the elements are lined up on the page.</p>

					<p>I think the best way for me to expand the way that I learn is for me to do more and more creative thinking as I go along.  Adding a small amount of creative thinking to my everyday life should make it easier for me to bring that into my experience at DBC.</p>
