        <p>
          Release 1: Research asking good questions<br><br>

Have you ever posted on the google+ community (or elsewhere) and didn't get the answer you needed? Were you frustrated by not receiving a response or did you review the question and consider why people weren't answering. Did you not give enough information? Was the question asked elsewhere? Was the question unclear? Learning how to ask good questions is a necessary skill for sucess as a developer. So take some time to research how to ask good questions.<br><br>

Here are a couple suggestions: -How do I ask a good question? -Writing the Perfect Question<br><br>

You may also want to research on asking good questions in person. Use the power of google.<br><br>

Release 2: Blog<br><br>

Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either the community, a friend, or yourself). Were these good questions? What was good/not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer.<br><br>

If you can't think of questions, go to the google+ community or stack overflow and analyze the questions.<br><br>

Make sure you keep these in mind for DBC! We are huge fans of students asking questions, but you'll need to ask good questions so you can get the answers that will help you. You should also feel free to ask for clarification and to push if you don't understand the answers you get.<br><br>

Release 3: Publish<br><br>

Link to your blog on the index of your site and push your changes.<br><br>

Make sure the index of your site is maintained, nice, and professional. This is your face in the online community, so make it nice!<br><br>

Release 4: Promote<br><br>

Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohortmates using Twitter!<br><br>

Tweet your blog post using #DBCPerfectQs<br><br>

Release 5: Read<br><br>

Read at least one post another student wrote. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, specific, and kind) feedback as an issue on their repo or a tweet!<br><br>
