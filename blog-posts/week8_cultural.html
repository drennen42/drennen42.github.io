        <p>Who's right and who's wrong?<br>
          <br>
          Many conflicts start with stubborness in two people, each having their own opinion on a single topic, and the opinions do not match up.<br><br>
          Other times conflicts are ignited over a person's ignorance and unwillingness to believe the truth.<br><br>
          Nomatter how conflicts begin, the burning ember of the flame stays lit until the answer for the question "Who's right and who's wrong?" can be answered and agreed upon by both parties. - A very difficult task for anybody and everybody.<br><br>
          Everyone wants to believe that they are right.  Nobody enjoys hearing someone with an opposing opinion on something tell them that they are wrong.
        </p>

        <p>I think there may be a couple opposing opinions once our cohort meets next week in phase 1 for the first time.  Some of us may enter the class thinking that we have a great understanding of certain things and others may understand them differently.  What makes a developer great is the ability to understand that everyone thinks, works, and understands things differently and to be able to be considerate to everyone's opinions.
        </p>

        <p>In my own experience, I have encountered some minor conflicts just recently while pair coding.  All challenges can be completed in a variety of ways using different techniques and methods.  In order for a pair to be successful, it's important to hear each other's ideas of which route to take and express any concerns in a polite and actionable way.</p>

        <p>Let's all just get along!  I really hope that everyone in our cohort can be very open-minded and respect each other's methodologies.  We are all coming into this with different levels of experience and knowledge, and with different skilsets.  If we all share our skills and knowledge with each other, we will all succeed together.</p>

        <p>That being said, I am PUMPED to start this thing!! LETS GO!</p>
