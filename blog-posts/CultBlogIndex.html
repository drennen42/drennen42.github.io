				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Kitchen vs. Table</strong></p>
				<p>** All answers are based on the video "Kitchen vs. Table" **</p>

				<p><strong>My take on the DBC experience:</strong></p>
				
				<p>Being a new "boot" in just the first week of phase 0, I don't feel like I am able to personally answer this question based on my own experiences.  Based on the video, the DBC experience will be many things.  The experience will be fun, tough, trying, stressful, successful, and overall worth the huge sacrifices and commitments necessary to be a sucessful DBC boot.</p>

				<p>In this type of culture, I see myself struggling quite a bit at first, as I am initially fairly stubborn, hard-headed, and stuck in my ways.  I believe that after I am able to get accustomed to the culture and environment, I will have a lot of fun, learn a ton, and be able to help my cohort boots partners succeed as well.</p>

				<p>Based on what Shereef said in the video about how at the end of the bootcamp, we will only be "...1/2 of 1 percent of a 'good developer'.", yes, my expectations have changed.  I was initially under the impression that at the end of the bootcamp, we would be able to apply for jobs as actual developers rather than classifying ourselves as junior or entry-level developers.  On the other hand, I now have a better understanding of what it takes to become a developer, and I now know that it would be literally impossible to become a full developer in a 9 week course.</p>

				<p>Overall, I am very excited and eager to be participating in the DBC environment!</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>My Thinking Style</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Concrete-Random</strong><p>
					Concrete-Random: Practical and live in the physical world, but they like to learn by trial and error.  Rather than a plan, they want options.				
				</p>

				<p>Characteristics of a Concrete-Random Mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Thinking processes are instinctive, intuitive, and impulsive.</li>
						<li>Events affected by outside variables.</li>
						<li>Focus on practical applications, methods, and processes.</li>
						<li>Creativity is original, inventive, and unique.</li>
						<li>Prefer an environment that is stimulus rich and competitive.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Abstract-Sequential</strong></p>
					<p>Abstract-Sequential: Like to develop ideas in a logical way.  How someone feels about something does not change reality.
				</p>

				<p>Characteristics of a Abstract-Sequential Mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Thinking processes are intellectual, analytical, correlative, fluid, and quick.</li>
						<li>Loves books.</li>
						<li>Focus attention on knowledge, concepts, and ideas.</li>
						<li>Creativity lies within models, theories, and synthesizing.</li>
						<li>Prefer an environment that is ordered, quiet, independent, and mentally stimulating.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>Being that my thinking style consists of many impulsive processes, many times I find myself jumping to do the first thing that comes to mind while reading through a challenge.  Many times I find out later that if I would have read the rest of the challenge more thoroughly, I could have saved myself a lot of time and energy.</p>

				<p>I have also found that the majority of the time when I am trying to be creative, I end up focusing more on practical applications.  This was a big challenge to overcome during week 1 of phase 0, when we were asked to be very creative and create unique web pages.</p>

				<p>The biggest struggle during unit 1 of phase 0 so far has been being creative while creating HTML and CSS webpages.  This does relate directly to my learning style because I keep thinking that after the proper ideas are portrayed, the stlying and creativness of a webpage does not matter in reality, hence the Abstract-Sequential characteristic of not believing that superfulous things do not change reality.  The reality is that the webpage is still just as functional with or without the attractive colors or the way the elements are lined up on the page.</p>

				<p>I think the best way for me to expand the way that I learn is for me to do more and more creative thinking as I go along.  Adding a small amount of creative thinking to my everyday life should make it easier for me to bring that into my experience at DBC.</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Technology At The Head of the Class[room]</strong></p>

				<p><b>Technology in our <em>elementary</em> education system</b> varies vastly from institution to institution across the United States.  Some school systems have implemented great modern technology strategies that include smartboards, netbooks, iPads, and more into the elementary classrooms.  But on the other hand, the majority of elementary schools in the United States have little to no technology in place.
				</p>
				<p>There are really two problems at hand here.  One being that the majority of elementary schools are not using modern technology to enhance the education of the young people of our country at all.  And the other is how technology is being used and taught in the schools that do have it.
				</p>
				<p>First order of business for all school system/districts that are lacking technological infrastructure should be to re-organize the system's budget and put the bulk into investing in high-tech computer systems that include updated computers, laptops, smartboards, wi-fi, etc etc.  These things have become an absoute necessity in the classroom.  When the future is bright for all people highly educated in technology, how are students expected to succeed in the workforce if they are coming out of school systems that have neglected from giving them ample hands-on experience with technology?
				</p>
				<p>Secondly, many elementary school systems that are fortunate enough to have the ability to have technology tied into every part of the education process are loaded with faculty and staff members who are unfamiliar with the technology themselves.  Worse yet, I hate to say it about American teachers (or Americans in general), but the <b>vast</b> majority of these technology-lacking teachers are not even willing to put in any effort into learning themselves.  
				</p>
				<p>Many elementary teachers are from generations in which they went through the education system without ever touching computer and feel strongly that it is still not a necessity to learn about them nor to use them in their teaching.  The problem gets worse in that the techers' union in the US is so strong, that once hired as a teacher, that person essentially cannot be fired based on things like their competency in technology, or their tech-lacking lesson plans.  Teachers that have been in the school system for many years have grown attached and comfortable in their methods that do not incorporate technology at all and they stick to their methods and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  They cannot be fired, they cannot be replaced, they cannot be reprimanded or have their salaries garnished.
				</p>
				<p>If I had the power, I would make it mandatory that all teachers be tested in modern technology annually.  If they do not pass the testing, at the very least their salary should be reduced.  At best, the education system should 'grade' teachers on tests like this and place teachers with higher scores in certain subjects with the corresponding lesson-plans.  If a teacher scores extremely high in the tech test, they should be given a raise and they should also be made a tech teacher.  If they score poorly, they should be docked and restricted to teaching subjects that do not require technology.  In any case, there should be a minimum set in which all current teachers must be above in order to continue teaching.  Other incentives can be put in place as well that reward teachers for learning new tech skills that they are then able to incorporate into their teaching methods and pass greater knowledge onto their students.
				</p>
				<p>All I know is that if my kid winds up in a classroom with a teacher that does not know how to use a computer effectively to today's standards, I'll be extremely upset, wouldn't you be?  Think of this scenario: your child is going into the 3rd grade next year.  There are two 3rd grade teachers, one is 28 years old and is efficient in all modern technology and implements it into almost every aspect of teaching.  The other teacher is 60 years old, computer-illiterate, uses only text-books, requires that all assignments are to be done with pencil and paper, and blatently refuses to even make an attempt to use technology despite requests by teachers, students, and the school's administration.  Which teacher would you demand that your child has next year? <b>I know my answer.</b>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Coding In Pairs</strong></p>

				<p>I am quickly learning the importance of development in pairs.  Pair sessions, as we call them in DevBootcamp, are when two or more people work together to solve a challenge. 
				</p>

				<p>Pair programming enables developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes, when done correctly.  Good lines of communication while working together are key.  This does not come easily and must be practiced.  Communication must be open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect.<sub>1</sub></p>

				<p>There are many advantages of peer-programming.  One advantage is that the coding is instantly checked by another set of eyes <b>as it is being created</b>.  This can save countless hours of debugging and editing down the road.  Imagine coding something yourself, and you're 250 lines into the code and something just isn't working.  You start testing and changing the code hoping to figure out what is causing the program to break, and after an hour or so of this, you find out that you put a colon instead of a semi-colon somewhere.  Or a period instead of a comma.  Something so minor yet so significant.  Syntax errors like this can be found immediately while writing that line of code if you were to have been working with a pair rather than by yourself.  And that hour that you spent searching for that period, could have been spent finishing the program or creating something new completely.</p>

				<p>This type of developing is rapidly becoming popular in the business world.  Employers are looking for developers who have experience programing seemlessly in pairs.  These developers can more efficiently, more quickly, create code that is better, nearly error free, and more durable than developers that work alone.</p>

				<p>In DBC, after a pair session, we are required to give feedback on the session and to the person we paired with.  The feedback is to be kind, actionable, and specific.  This type of feedback is to help us learn to be great partners and be sought-after developers upon graduation.</p>

				<p>Kind feedback does not necessarily mean that is has to be "nice", per say.  Kind feedback just means that it should not be hateful not hurtful, but more respectfully constructive.  If I were a stubborn partner that did not listen to the ideas of my partner, I would hope and expect to have feedback that said "I wish you were more open to hearing and possibly using some of my ideas during this pair session."  This is kind and respectful feedback.  It tells me that I was selfish and stubborn during the session without actually saying "You are very selfish and stubborn."  Also, that feedback gives me something actionable to work on.  Instead of trying to work on my overall stubborness, I would know to start working on hearing and using my partners ideas.</p>

				<p>Actionable feedback is just that, feedback that the person can use as something to work on for their future sessions and to learn and grow from.</p>

				<p>It is only helpful if the feedback is specific.  If the feedback were to just say "It was a good session, we achieved our goals."  there would be nothing for the person to work on.  More importantly, if they did something particularly well, that should be stated so they know to continue doing that.</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Stereotype Threats</strong></p>
				<p>A Stereotype threat is defined by www.oxfodscholarship.com as "a situational predicament in which individuals are at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their group. It is the resulting sense that one might be judged in terms of negative stereotypes about one's group instead of on personal merit."
				</p>

				<p>There have been many studies done on stereoype threats.  The results of the studies show that when two groups, one group being the group that is the subject of a stereotype and the other group being the opposite of the stereotype, are given the same test, the first time with no prior knowledge of the test being a stereotype test, both groups performed relatively equally.  Then, the second time, the groups are informed that the purpose of the test is related to the stereotype, the group that is the subject/victim of the stereotype performed down to the level of the stereotype.
				</p>

				<p>For example, there is a stereotype that African Americans are bad academic test takers.  A group of Caucasians and a group of African Americans are given the same test, with no knowledge of the purpose of the test, both groups performed well.  Then, when the African Americans were informed that the purpose of the test is to determine whether or not the stereotype of African Americans are bad test takers, the group of African Americans performed worse.  Simply because the expectations are lowered due to the stereotype, the stereotype is confirmed.
				</p>

				<p>I cannot think of a time when I felt like a victim of a stereotype threat.  However, I can imagine how it could and does effect people who are victims.  I believe that it is human nature to gravitate towards performing to expectations of ourselves.  When expectations are lowered due to stereotyping, we evolve and react accordingly to the level of the stereotype.</p>

				<p>I believe that the solution to stereotype threats can be achieved by spreading the word about the effects of stereotypes.  Stereotype Threats are a serious problem and effect everyone in one way or another.  Since stereotypes are created over a long period of time and evolution of whole groups of people, concquoring stereotype threats will take many years and a lot of selfless, humble dedication by multiple generations in succession to allow for new evolution to occur.  But, the change must start somewhere and it must begin with strong individuals standing up for their beliefs.  Be a part of the change for the better and do not put up with stereotype threats and make all attempts to change the minds of those doing the stereotyping.
