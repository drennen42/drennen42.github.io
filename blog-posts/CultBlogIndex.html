				<p>** All answers are based on the video "Kitchen vs. Table" **</p>

				<p><strong>My take on the DBC experience:</strong></p>
				
				<p>Being a new "boot" in just the first week of phase 0, I don't feel like I am able to personally answer this question based on my own experiences.  Based on the video, the DBC experience will be many things.  The experience will be fun, tough, trying, stressful, successful, and overall worth the huge sacrifices and commitments necessary to be a sucessful DBC boot.</p>

				<p>In this type of culture, I see myself struggling quite a bit at first, as I am initially fairly stubborn, hard-headed, and stuck in my ways.  I believe that after I am able to get accustomed to the culture and environment, I will have a lot of fun, learn a ton, and be able to help my cohort boots partners succeed as well.</p>

				<p>Based on what Shereef said in the video about how at the end of the bootcamp, we will only be "...1/2 of 1 percent of a 'good developer'.", yes, my expectations have changed.  I was initially under the impression that at the end of the bootcamp, we would be able to apply for jobs as actual developers rather than classifying ourselves as junior or entry-level developers.  On the other hand, I now have a better understanding of what it takes to become a developer, and I now know that it would be literally impossible to become a full developer in a 9 week course.</p>

				<p>Overall, I am very excited and eager to be participating in the DBC environment!</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>My Thinking Style</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Concrete-Random</strong><p>
					Concrete-Random: Practical and live in the physical world, but they like to learn by trial and error.  Rather than a plan, they want options.				
				</p>

				<p>Characteristics of a Concrete-Random Mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Thinking processes are instinctive, intuitive, and impulsive.</li>
						<li>Events affected by outside variables.</li>
						<li>Focus on practical applications, methods, and processes.</li>
						<li>Creativity is original, inventive, and unique.</li>
						<li>Prefer an environment that is stimulus rich and competitive.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Abstract-Sequential</strong></p>
					<p>Abstract-Sequential: Like to develop ideas in a logical way.  How someone feels about something does not change reality.
				</p>

				<p>Characteristics of a Abstract-Sequential Mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Thinking processes are intellectual, analytical, correlative, fluid, and quick.</li>
						<li>Loves books.</li>
						<li>Focus attention on knowledge, concepts, and ideas.</li>
						<li>Creativity lies within models, theories, and synthesizing.</li>
						<li>Prefer an environment that is ordered, quiet, independent, and mentally stimulating.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>Being that my thinking style consists of many impulsive processes, many times I find myself jumping to do the first thing that comes to mind while reading through a challenge.  Many times I find out later that if I would have read the rest of the challenge more thoroughly, I could have saved myself a lot of time and energy.</p>

				<p>I have also found that the majority of the time when I am trying to be creative, I end up focusing more on practical applications.  This was a big challenge to overcome during week 1 of phase 0, when we were asked to be very creative and create unique web pages.</p>

				<p>The biggest struggle during unit 1 of phase 0 so far has been being creative while creating HTML and CSS webpages.  This does relate directly to my learning style because I keep thinking that after the proper ideas are portrayed, the stlying and creativness of a webpage does not matter in reality, hence the Abstract-Sequential characteristic of not believing that superfulous things do not change reality.  The reality is that the webpage is still just as functional with or without the attractive colors or the way the elements are lined up on the page.</p>

				<p>I think the best way for me to expand the way that I learn is for me to do more and more creative thinking as I go along.  Adding a small amount of creative thinking to my everyday life should make it easier for me to bring that into my experience at DBC.</p>

				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Technology At The Head of the Class[room]</strong></p>

				<p><b>Technology in our <em>elementary</em> education system</b> varies vastly from institution to institution across the United States.  Some school systems have implemented great modern technology strategies that include smartboards, netbooks, iPads, and more into the elementary classrooms.  But on the other hand, the majority of elementary schools in the United States have little to no technology in place.
				</p>
				<p>There are really two problems at hand here.  One being that the majority of elementary schools are not using modern technology to enhance the education of the young people of our country at all.  And the other is how technology is being used and taught in the schools that do have it.
				</p>
				<p>First order of business for all school system/districts that are lacking technological infrastructure should be to re-organize the system's budget and put the bulk into investing in high-tech computer systems that include updated computers, laptops, smartboards, wi-fi, etc etc.  These things have become an absoute necessity in the classroom.  When the future is bright for all people highly educated in technology, how are students expected to succeed in the workforce if they are coming out of school systems that have neglected from giving them ample hands-on experience with technology?
				</p>
				<p>Secondly, many elementary school systems that are fortunate enough to have the ability to have technology tied into every part of the education process are loaded with faculty and staff members who are unfamiliar with the technology themselves.  Worse yet, I hate to say it about American teachers (or Americans in general), but the <b>vast</b> majority of these technology-lacking teachers are not even willing to put in any effort into learning themselves.  
				</p>
				<p>Many elementary teachers are from generations in which they went through the education system without ever touching computer and feel strongly that it is still not a necessity to learn about them nor to use them in their teaching.  The problem gets worse in that the techers' union in the US is so strong, that once hired as a teacher, that person essentially cannot be fired based on things like their competency in technology, or their tech-lacking lesson plans.  Teachers that have been in the school system for many years have grown attached and comfortable in their methods that do not incorporate technology at all and they stick to their methods and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  They cannot be fired, they cannot be replaced, they cannot be reprimanded or have their salaries garnished.
				</p>
				<p>If I had the power, I would make it mandatory that all teachers be tested in modern technology annually.  If they do not pass the testing, at the very least their salary should be reduced.  At best, the education system should 'grade' teachers on tests like this and place teachers with higher scores in certain subjects with the corresponding lesson-plans.  If a teacher scores extremely high in the tech test, they should be given a raise and they should also be made a tech teacher.  If they score poorly, they should be docked and restricted to teaching subjects that do not require technology.  In any case, there should be a minimum set in which all current teachers must be above in order to continue teaching.  Other incentives can be put in place as well that reward teachers for learning new tech skills that they are then able to incorporate into their teaching methods and pass greater knowledge onto their students.
				</p>
				<p>All I know is that if my kid winds up in a classroom with a teacher that does not know how to use a computer effectively to today's standards, I'll be extremely upset, wouldn't you be?  Think of this scenario: your child is going into the 3rd grade next year.  There are two 3rd grade teachers, one is 28 years old and is efficient in all modern technology and implements it into almost every aspect of teaching.  The other teacher is 60 years old, computer-illiterate, uses only text-books, requires that all assignments are to be done with pencil and paper, and blatently refuses to even make an attempt to use technology despite requests by teachers, students, and the school's administration.  Which teacher would you demand that your child has next year? <b>I know my answer.</b>
