				<p style="font-size:36px;text-align:center"><strong>Life Values</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Exploring Your Values: </strong><br>
					Values that I relate to times when I remember experiencing being happy, proud, and most satisfied:
					<ul>
						<li>Achievement</li>
						<li>Excellence</li>
						<li>Creativity</li>
						<li>Courage</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Value Selected: Achievement</strong><br>
					There are a few times in my life that when I am reminded of them I get a strong feeling of happiness and am proud of my accomplishments.  Most of these moments are times in which I had accomplished something.  In sports, I was blessed with a childhood full of baseball-related accomplishments from winning the little league homerun derby to being a part of the all-star team that participated in the Senior League Central States tournament (the best team from each of the central states Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio) to being recruited and awarded scholarships to play at the collegiate level.  Memories of playing high school football also bring me high levels of happiness as well.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Living up to these values</strong><br>
					In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>

					Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Achievement: 4</li>
						<li>Excellence: 4</li>
						<li>Creativity: 3</li>
						<li>Courage: 3</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Values and Stereotype threat</strong><br>
					Honestly, when I think about my values, it makes me feel a bit conceded.  It made me realize that my memories of being the happiest are all times when I suceeded personally, and not of times when I helped others succeed or when I gave back to others. There very well could be a stereotype threat at play here.  If there is a stereotype that is based on people similar to myself and how we are selfish or conceded, I would now have to believe it.  It's possible that I am this way because of the stereotype, making it a stereotype threat.  Have I been brought up to feel the happiest only when I succeed personally? Quite possibly.  It may be even more conceded to say this, but I would have to say that this stereotype threat would have to be one of the best ones to fall victim to.  But, I could seriously benefit from exercises where I learn to be happy in failures, knowing that I have learned from the failure and that success is still possible in future attempts.
